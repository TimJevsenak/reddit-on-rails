# reddit-on-rails
A clone of the social media site reddit. Made with RoR. Reddit-on-rails is an imitation of the website reddit.com. I made it for a school project. It's pretty similar to reddit in terms of basic functions but the design is my own.

# Features
Read-it is a social media platform where users can create communities, share their posts and comment. You can upload your images and customise your profile. 
There is also an admin panel where admins can delete users, posts and communities.

# Installation
Download the files and place them in a folder. Import the database into MySQL.

It uses php so you will need server for it to actually work (ex. apache).

The database is setup so that you can start using the web app right away.

If you want to send emails whit your own mail server, you will need to change the code in user_insert.php and forgot_password_send.php

If you want to use the Google and Facebook login, you will have to request your own API key for both of them. Once you do that and replace it, it should work.

# Setup
Just log in and if your database is set correctly you are good to go!

# Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

# Language
The website is in english.

Backend is also fully english.
